        <h1> Bio </h1>
        <p>  My name is Frazia Jan. I am an Information Management & Technology major at the ischool and some interests I have in this major include web design, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Some skills I have include being organized and efficient in a work environment, being able to cooperate and engage with a group of people, and talking in a large group setting as well. Outside of the workplace I enjoy working out and going to the gym, shopping for clothes and sneakers and cooking. I am a very big family person and my brothers are my best friends! I also love my car.</p>
